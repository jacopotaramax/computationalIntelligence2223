## Lab 1
Made in collab with a colleague, Gabriele Canova

It has been used an A* search, the algorithm is based on a choice made on the maximum ratio between the difference given by the subset and the already covered set divided by the intersection of the subset lenght.
 

It has resulted in a releveant improvement of the greedy version. We have seen better performances in terms of weights by using a bigger N value, despite an incremented computational time
