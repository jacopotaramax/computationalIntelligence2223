## Algorithms

To obtain these results, various tests were carried out to improve and fine-tune the parameters.

It is also possible to use a crossover function with the cutting of the lists in two points but it becomes computationally heavy (it has however been implemented)

## Results

We get the optimal solution for n = 5, n = 20, for some reason n = 10 does not get the optimal solution with this configuration but was sacrificed in name of better results for n = 100,500,1000

## Future improvement

A improvement could be obtained by changing the NUM_GENERATION dynamically so if there are no better changes for several generation we can avoid further computations.
